### üé® Card Design Exploration (`/card-demo`)
We explored 25+ different card designs and narrowed down to the best options:

#### **Selected Cards (User Approved)**
1. **Card #1: Netflix-Style FAB** ‚≠ê **PRIMARY CHOICE**
   - Netflix aesthetic with gold accent colors
   - Floating Action Button (FAB) for follow actions

3. **Card #5: Improved FAB**
   - Enhanced version with clear tooltips
   - Dynamic color states
   - Status badges and labeled options

#### **SaaS-Inspired Follow Patterns (10 Options)**
Created professional follow patterns inspired by top SaaS companies:
- Slack-style toggle buttons
- GitHub-style watch button
- Linear-style chips
- Notion-style checkboxes
- Figma-style action menu
- Stripe-style radio buttons
- Airtable-style dropdown
